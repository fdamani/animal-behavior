2.4.18

	convo with rpa
		- problem with mean field fully factorized approach is it underestimated joint posterior correlations
		- need a richer posterior approximation 
		- spoke to ryan about amortization vs richness of posterior
		- conclusion: parameterizing with rnn doesn't help bc its a deterministic computation - we need randomness 
		- try AR-1, some covariance structure, hmm

	agenda:
		- implement new model class with nonlinear transition matrix
			- try a simpler nonlinear transition model.
				- can we recover correct model parameters?
		- improve vi
			- compute posterior mean, variances and model parameters for lds and log reg

	- add python special key that lets you break out of optimization but not cancel program



2.3.18
	- wrote model class
	- wrote lds, log_reg_lds
	- wrote VI inference class
	- implemented above models with gradient descent for map estimation
